# Vybez Chat App

## Overview
Vybez is a real-time chat application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It provides a full-featured chatroom experience with user authentication, custom chat rooms, private messaging, file sharing, and a modern, responsive interface. The project serves as a learning platform for Node.js development, currently configured and running in a Replit environment. Vybez offers a robust, multi-platform chat solution, including a full-featured Electron desktop client. The desktop app is live at https://www.vybez.page with Microsoft Store certification in progress (Store ID: 9NN89Z3HS891, Identity: VIBECO.Vybez).

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations and an iterative development approach. Ask before making major changes. Do not make changes to files within the `sessions/` directory.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a "Neon Nightlife" aesthetic with a brand slogan "BREAK FREE". The color palette includes Midnight base, Deep Violet (primary), Electric Magenta, Cyber Cyan, and a Warm accent. Typography uses Space Grotesk for headings and Inter for body text. The design incorporates modern glassmorphism and gradient effects, with a unified 4-column footer across all web pages. The UI is built using Tailwind CSS v4, replacing Bootstrap, and features a custom modal system.

### Technical Implementations
Vybez is a Node.js application using Express.js for the backend and Socket.IO for real-time communication. User authentication uses bcrypt for password hashing, and sessions are managed with `express-session` and a file-based store. The application uses PostgreSQL as its primary database, hosted on Replit's managed Neon database. Frontend development uses vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS v4.

Key Features include:
- **User Authentication:** Secure signup/login with bcrypt.
- **Custom Chat Rooms:** Users can create and delete rooms, with real-time updates via Socket.IO.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Instant message delivery, message history, typing indicators, and message reactions.
- **User Profiles:** Customizable avatars, bios, status, and chat colors.
- **File Sharing:** Uploads up to 10MB (images, documents, videos) with secure filename generation and automatic image previews.
- **Private Messaging:** Direct messages with notifications and read receipts.
- **Message Search:** Functionality to search through message history.
- **User Roles:** Admin and standard user permission system.

### System Design Choices
The application is structured with a clear separation between server-side logic (`server.js`, `database.js`), client-side logic (`public/client.js`), and Electron-specific components (`electron.js`, `preload.js`, `desktop-integration.js`). Database interactions are handled via `pg` for PostgreSQL. The system uses a file-based session store to maintain user sessions. All frontend styles are built with `@tailwindcss/cli`, ensuring a lean and production-ready CSS output.

### Electron Desktop Client
A full-featured Electron desktop client provides enhanced user experience with:
- Desktop notifications for new messages.
- System tray integration with context menu (minimize to tray, always on top, auto-launch, quit).
- Badge counts on the app icon for unread messages.
- Global keyboard shortcuts.
- Native dark mode detection.
- Offline detection.
- Auto-updater for seamless updates.
- Auto-launch on startup.
- Native file picker for uploads.
- Window bounds persistence.
- Secure IPC communication via a preload script.

### Database Schema
- **`users`**: id, username, password, chat_color, bio, status, avatar_url, role
- **`messages`**: id, room, username, message_text, chat_color, timestamp, file_url, file_type
- **`reactions`**: id, message_id (FK), username, emoji
- **`private_messages`**: id, from_user, to_user, message_text, timestamp, read
- **`read_receipts`**: id, message_id (FK), username, read_at
- **`rooms`**: id, name (UNIQUE), created_by, created_at, is_default

All tables utilize PostgreSQL SERIAL for auto-incrementing IDs and proper CASCADE foreign key constraints.

## External Dependencies
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database (Replit managed Neon database).
- **`pg`**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- **`express-session`**: Middleware for session management.
- **`session-file-store`**: File system-based session store.
- **`bcrypt`**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **`multer`**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` (file uploads).
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Electron**: Framework for building desktop applications with web technologies.
- **`electron-builder`**: Tool for packaging and distributing Electron apps.
- **`auto-launch`**: For launching Electron apps on system startup.
- **`electron-updater`**: For enabling auto-updates in Electron apps.
- **`electron-store`**: For simple data persistence in Electron apps.
- **Google Fonts CDN**: For loading Space Grotesk and Inter fonts.
- **Discord Webhook**: For server-wide activity logging and monitoring (DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL stored in environment secrets).

## Health Monitoring
The server includes a `/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring and status checks:
- **Endpoint:** `GET /health`
- **Response Format:** JSON with status, uptime, timestamp, and database connectivity
- **HTTP Status Codes:** 
  - `200 OK` - Server and database are healthy
  - `503 Service Unavailable` - Database connection error
- **Use Cases:** External monitoring services, load balancers, deployment verification

Example response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "uptime": 14.977,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T23:19:05.476Z",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

## Discord Integration
The platform includes comprehensive Discord webhook logging for real-time monitoring of server-wide activities:
- **üìù User Registration:** Logged when new users join the platform
- **üîê User Login:** Logged when users authenticate (includes client type: üåê Web, üíª Desktop, ü§ñ API)
- **üè† Room Creation:** Logged when custom chat rooms are created
- **üóëÔ∏è Room Deletion:** Logged when chat rooms are removed
- **üìé File Uploads:** Logged when files are uploaded to the platform
- **üí¨ Chat Messages:** Logged when messages are sent in chat rooms (with 100-char preview and client type)
- **üìß Private Messages:** Logged when direct messages are sent between users (with 100-char preview and client type)

All webhook notifications include:
- Color-coded embeds matching the brand identity (violet, cyan, magenta)
- Client detection to differentiate between Web (üåê), Desktop (üíª), and External API/Discord bot (ü§ñ) usage
- Real-time delivery to the configured Discord channel
